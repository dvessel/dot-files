# .zsh_plugins.txt - antidote plugins file
#

# The `.zsh_plugins.txt` file is used by antidote to configure Zsh bundles. Bundles are
# just a fancy way of referring to Zsh utilities, frameworks, prompts, or plugins.
#
# NOTE: Order matters in this file! Some bundles need to be last, and others are
# prerequisites. Read the documentation for the plugins you use to ensure proper
# configuration.
#
# Example: https://github.com/getantidote/zdotdir/blob/main/.zsh_plugins.txt

# With antidote, using Zephyr's completion plugin is recommended. This plugin is meant
# to be run near the TOP of your .zsh_plugins.txt file. Includes zsh-users/zsh-completions.
