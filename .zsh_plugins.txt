# .zsh_plugins.txt - antidote plugins file
#

## Overview
# The `.zsh_plugins.txt` file is used by antidote to configure Zsh bundles. Bundles are
# just a fancy way of referring to Zsh utilities, frameworks, prompts, or plugins.
#
# NOTE: Order matters in this file! Some bundles need to be last, and others are
# prerequisites. Read the documentation for the plugins you use to ensure proper
# configuration.

# zsh-users/zsh-completions is a popular plugin for adding supplemental completions.
# We combine the `path:` and `kind:fpath` annotations here:
zsh-users/zsh-completions path:src kind:fpath

# Compinit plugins should be near the end of .zsh_plugins.txt so that $fpath has been
# fully populated. Use zsh-utils for its completion plugin. Runs compinit.
belak/zsh-utils path:completion

# https://github.com/Aloxaf/fzf-tab
# fzf-tab needs to be loaded after compinit, but before plugins which will wrap widgets, 
# such as zsh-autosuggestions or fast-syntax-highlighting!!

## Deferred Plugins
# In general, you should not defer plugins unless you know for sure they properly support
# deferred loading, and there are no adverse side-effects. However, for certain plugins,
# this can greatly increase your zsh startup speed.
